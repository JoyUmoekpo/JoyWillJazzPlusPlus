# JoyWillJazz++ --- Project 1 

## Description 
We have created an application that sends the users photo to an API called Face ++ which analyzes the problem areas of their skin and face. We then send that information to a second Google Search API which searches predetermined sites for products that could help with those problem areas. The application that we have created serves several purposes. The utilitarian purpose is second to  the penultimate purpose of this application to amuse and entertain the user. The idea that their photo can be analyzed for problem areas and then they can be recommended a product for the process is enough to wow most users with the advancements we have made over the years in technology. The stretch goal for this product would be for it to give the most accurate recommendation to the user. However, that is dependant on the reliability or "confidence" of the Face ++ API.

The application is hosted on GitHub Pages environment.


## Usage 

The user has the option of uploading a photo or pasting a link to to their photo. The photo is then provided via AJAX call to the Face ++ API. When the results are returned, the ((Selected Websites - Target)) are searched for products that they sell to assist with those problem areas. 
 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md

```
